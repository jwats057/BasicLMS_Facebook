Description:

The goal of the project is to build a basic Learning Management System (LMS)
App on Facebook that allows for online training in developing countries. 
This is for short online courses (5 to 15 hours) that include videos posted
on youtube or Facebook, multiple-choice tests, PDF materials, and 2-hour live
streaming. Everything should be within the Facebook platform and maximize
the internet speed, considering the low download /upload Internet speed in
developing countries.
